## RecipesWebsite

### Presentation
(mivindo) This is a project in collaboration with @chriSmile0. I wanted to build a new recipe website and asked for his help. First, I decided what type of content I wanted to create. 
I wanted to write recipes, with images and an interactive interface. Whether for 2, 4 or 6 people, I want the readers to be able to change the quantities or even choose the additional ingredients in real time.
